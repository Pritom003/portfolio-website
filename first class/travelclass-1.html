    <p>“Travel is more than the seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas of living” – Miriam Beard.

      It may be very cliche to say that travel has the power to change and inspire but as cliche as it may be, it’s also very true. From a young age, I have been fascinated by travelling and exploring the sights which I never knew even existed. The endless possibilities of places to visit and sites to explore have intrigued me. Growing up I was fortunate to travel around the places with my family which allowed me to broaden my horizon and shape my personality.
      
      When I travel to different countries, I get excited to experience a new culture and their norms. I believe that’s exhilarating because when I experience something new for the first time, I transition into an individual full of life and vitality – just like kids. My adventurous trip to Thailand still seems like a fantasy. Thailand is also known as the ‘Land of Smiles’. A country that is completely different from ours is waiting for us, a new breed of people and a completely new experience. I hold on to the armrests of the airplane seat as it gained enough speed and finally lifted off. overpowered by exhaustion, I fell into a deep, profound sleep. The next morning, I am awakened by a stewardess announcing to fasten the seat belts as we are approaching near the airport. I remember thinking we have landed in a strange city by mistake. Everything seems distinctly odd. There is something different in the air and I seemed to be the only person who could perceive it. The strange new environment convinces me to go back home, however we drive through the city of Bangkok to reach our final destination. I shift my gaze from the street food stalls to the strange lined faces of the street sellers and passers-by, to the bright colors of tuk-tuks, to the constant traffic jams and of course the glorious religious temples. After viewing the alluring beauty of Bangkok, the odd feeling turns into excitement. We spend the first night exploring the city called Sukhumvit. A city that is full of chaos, noise and the briny smell of Thai food. We are wandering through the streets to find a halal restaurant. My father begins to ask the local people to help us locate the restaurant. We come across a tuk-tuk driver who is unable to communicate in English yet he goes above and beyond to help us find the restaurant. That night I realized that no matter what language someone speaks, two willing humans can always find a way to communicate with each other. I enter the restaurant and occupy a table near the giant aesthetic sea green painting. I look around to witness the differences between people only to find out that we aren’t so different. We all have a family we love and care about, jobs to go to during the day, and people are generally nice to each other regardless of their backgrounds. If I only rely on media, I would probably never have enjoyed an experience like this.</p>
